						In order for a foreign student to be able to apply for the Italian Identity Card, you need to change your residence to Trento. The foreign student must be in possession of the residence permit (permesso di soggiorno) AND they must have a housing contract in Trento. It is a bit lengthy, but quite a straightforward process. 
You need to download the form 1103 cambio residenza which can be found HERE. Instructions to fill the form can be found HERE.
The necessary sessions of the form 1103 must be completed. We advise getting some help from one of your Italian colleagues in doing this. 
Once you complete and sign form 1103, you need to gather the below documents:
Copy of your passport bio page
Copy of your residence permit 
Codice fiscale (copy of your health card, or copy of the official document you got with the codice fiscale)
Copy of your housing contract
Registration of your housing contract
Once you gather the documents, attach EVERYTHING into an email, and send to cambioresidenza@comune.trento.it. Be sure to include your email contact details (phone number, email address) in case they need to contact you.
Someone from the police station will come to your house to actually verify that you are living there. While filling the form 1103, there is a section where you can specify a preferred time for them to come. Please make sure that you specify a day and time window when you will be at home - and stay home during this window until someone comes.
If you have any questions, you can contact 0461 884067 in the afternoon.
