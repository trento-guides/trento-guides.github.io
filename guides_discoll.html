                                        <h1>How to ask for Unemployment</h1>

                                        <p>The DIS-COLL allowance is due to coordinated and continuous collaborators, including project collaborators, research fellows and PhD students with scholarships who have involuntarily lost their job and who are registered exclusively with the Separate Management at INPS.</p>
                                    </header>
                                    <div class="image main"><img src="#" alt="" /></div>

									<p>There comes that time for every PhD student, after the euphoria of celebration, the sudden realization that you will no longer be paid. There is a way to ask for unemployment until you find a job. Here are some information about the DIS-COLL.</p>

									<ol>
										<li>The DIS-COLL starts from the eighth day following the termination of the collaboration relationship or research grant/PhD with scholarship, if the application is submitted within the eighth day; from the day after the application is submitted, if it is submitted after the eighth day after cessation; SO SUBMIT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!
										</li>
										<li>DIS-COLL is paid monthly for a number of months equal to the months of contributions credited in the period between 1 January of the year preceding the event of cessation of work and the aforementioned event. In any case, the benefit can be paid for a maximum duration of 12 months.</li>
										<li>Unemployment benefit is equal to 75% of the average monthly income.</li>
									</ol>



									<p><h2>Instructions to apply:</h2></p>

									<ol>
										<li>Before you start the procedure, here are some documents to have ready.</li>
										<ul>
											<li>The enrollment certificate stating the end date of your contract.</li>
											<li>Any documents if you got an extension/study grant.</li>
											<li>Copy of your permesso di soggiorno.</li>
											<li>Documents to show your residency in Trento.</li>
											<li>Bank statement showing your last salary.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Log in to INPS, and start a new application from the portal <a href="http://inps.it/it/it/risultati-ricerca.html?fulltext=Portale%20disoccupazione"><b>HERE</b></a>.
										</li>
										<li>Or log in to INPS and search for DIS-COLL, and start an application.</li>
										<li>There is a decent amount of things to fill, and some things to declare. Everything is self-explanatory. I suggest you use the google translate plugin in your browser to figure out difficult parts. </li>
										<li>You will be asked to enter your IBAN, and you will be asked to uplaod all documents that I mentioned above.</li>
										<li>As of today (25/02/25), I am still waiting for an answer. I will update as soon as I know anything more.</li>
									</ol>
