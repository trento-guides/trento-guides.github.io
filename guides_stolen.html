                                        <p>I know it sucks, but sometimes people can be the worst. In the unfortunate case that your residence permit was stolen or lost, follow this guide to get a replacement.</p>

                                    <center><div class="image"><img src="images/thief.jpg" alt="" style="width:75%"/></div></center>

									<p>First, brance yourself and get mentally prepared. Italian buereocracy is exhausting, and no one wants to actually help you. Also be prepared for some racism at the post office (unfortunately I got kind of a big dose of it as a caramel colored human). It's difficult, but you can get it done. <br><br>
									I am writing this guide based on my own experience. My wallet was stolen in France, and was able to come back to Italy by car. I ojly lost my wallet with the residence permit and bank cards, I did not lose my passport thankfully.<br/><br/> 
									If it happened aborad outside Europe, or if you lost your passport as well, the best thing to do is contact your embassy.</p>

									<ol>
										<li>First and most important - GET A POLICE REPORT! <br/>
										If the theft happened outside Italy, but still in the European Union, go to the nearest police station to report the theft and get a police report. <br/>
										Then greport the thesft to the questura and get a report in Italian. Thankfully, the questura in Trento is very helpful and kind, and the officer that hepled me spoke very good English. <br/>
										Take all the documents you have with you. If not take copies. However you will need some soft of an official ID to prove you are who you say you are. 
										</li>

										<li>Now that you have police reports, go the post office and ask for the <strong>permesso di soggiorno kit</strong>.</li>
										<li>Complete module A. Specify that you need a duplicatre. After you filled the forms, gather the below items:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Photocopies of all pages of all your passports. Only the filled/stamped pages.</li>
											<li>Marco di Bollo - 16 Euro stamp you can buy at any tobacco shop</li>
											<li>Copy of lost residence permit</li>
											<li>Copy of police report from the questura</li>
											<li>Copy of police report from the country where the theft happened</li>
										</ul>

										<li>Go back to the post office with the filled module A and all the above documents. You will need to pay 30 Euro for the kit, and 30 Euro for the procedure. You can pay by cash or card.</li>
										<li>After you pay, you will get an appointment date and time at the questura, along with the postal receipt which acts as a temporary residence permit.</li>
										<li>You will need the below documents on the day you go to the questura:
										<ul>
											<li>Passport</li>
											<li>Photocopies of all pages of all your passports. Only the filled/stamped pages.</li>
											<li>Copy of police report from the questura</li>
											<li>Copy of police report from the country where the theft happened</li>
											<li>Copy of lost residence permit</li>
											<li>Postal receipt</li>
											<li>4 photos.</li>											
										</ul>									

										<li>The Theprocess at the Questura is the same as when you are renewing. Present your appointment letter and police reports. They will ask your biometrics, then give you a refernce number to tcheck the status.</li>
									</ol>
